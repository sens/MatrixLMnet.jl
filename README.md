# MatrixLMnet: Core functions for penalized estimation for matrix linear models.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/senresearch/MatrixLMnet.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/senresearch/MatrixLMnet.jl)

Package for L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> penalized estimation of
 matrix linear models (bilinear models for matrix-valued data).

`MatrixLMnet` depends on the [`MatrixLM`](https://github.com/senresearch/MatrixLM.jl) package, 
which provides core functions for closed-form least squares estimates for matrix linear models. 

See the paper, ["Sparse matrix linear models for structured high-throughput data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05767), and its [reproducible code](https://github.com/senresearch/mlm_l1_supplement) for details on the L<sub>1</sub> penalized estimation.


## Installation 

The `MatrixLMnet` package can be installed by running: 

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MatrixLMnet")
```

For the most recent version, use:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/senresearch/MatrixLMnet.jl", rev="master")
```

## Usage 

```
using MatrixLMnet
```

First, construct a `RawData` object consisting of the response variable `Y` and row/column covariates `X` and `Z`. All three matrices must be passed in as 2-dimensional arrays. Note that the `contr` function can be used to set up treatment and/or sum contrasts for categorical variables stored in a DataFrame. By default, `contr` generates treatment contrasts for all specified categorical variables (`"treat"`). Other options include `"sum"` for sum contrasts, `"noint"` for treatment contrasts with no intercept, and `"sumnoint"` for sum contrasts with no intercept. 

```
using DataFrames
using Random

# Dimensions of matrices 
n = 100
m = 250
# Number of column covariates
q = 20

# Randomly generate an X matrix of row covariates with 2 categorical variables
# and 4 continuous variables
Random.seed!(1)
X_df = hcat(DataFrame(catvar1=rand(1:5, n), catvar2=rand(["A", "B", "C"], n)), 
            DataFrame(rand(n,4)))
# Use the contr function to get contrasts for the two categorical variables 
# (treatment contrasts for catvar1 and sum contrasts for catvar2).
# contr returns a DataFrame, so X needs to be converted into a 2d array.
X = convert(Array{Float64,2}, contr(X_df, [:catvar1, :catvar2], 
                                    ["treat", "sum"]))
# Number of row covariates
p = size(X)[2]

# Randomly generate some data for column covariates Z and response variable Y
Z = rand(m,q)
B = rand(vcat(-5:5, zeros(19)),p,q)
E = randn(n,m)
Y = X*B*transpose(Z)+E

# Construct a RawData object
dat = RawData(Response(Y), Predictors(X, Z))
```

Create a 1d array of lambda penalty values to fit the estimates. If the lambdas are not in descending order, they will be automatically sorted by `mlmnet`. 

```
lambdas = reverse(1.8.^(1:10))
```

L<sub>1</sub>-penalized estimates for matrix linear models can be obtained by running `mlmnet`. In addition to the `RawData` object and `lambdas`, `mlmnet` requires as an argument the function name for an algorithm used to fit L<sub>1</sub>-penalized estimates. Current options are:`cd!` (coordinate descent), `cd_active!` (active coordinate descent), `ista!` (ISTA with fixed step size), `fista!` (FISTA with fixed step size), `fista_bt!` (FISTA with backtracking), and `admm!` (ADMM). 

An object of type `Mlmnet` will be returned, with variables for the penalized coefficient estimates (`B`) and the lambda penalty values used (`lambdas`). By default, `mlmnet` estimates both row and column main effects (X and Z intercepts), but this behavior can be suppressed by setting `isXIntercept=false` and/or `isZntercept=false`; the intercepts will be regularized unless `isXInterceptReg=false` and/or `isZInterceptReg=false`. Individual `X` (row) and `Z` (column) effects can be left unregularized by manually passing in 1d boolean arrays of length `p` and `q` to indicate which effects should be regularized (`true`) or not (`false`) into `isXReg` and `isZreg`. By default, `mlmnet` standardizes the columns of `X` and `Z` to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 (`isStandardize=true`). Additional keyword arguments include `isVerbose`, which controls message printing; `thresh`, the threshold at which the coefficients are considered to have converged; and `maxiter`, the maximum number of iterations. 

```
est = mlmnet(fista_bt!, dat, lambdas)
```

The functions for the algorithms used to fit the L<sub>1</sub>-penalized estimates have keyword arguments that can be passed into `mlmnet` when non-default behavior is desired. Irrelevant keyword arguments will be ignored. 

`cd!` (coordinate descent)
- `isRandom= true`: Bool; whether to use random or cyclic updates

`cd_active!` (active coordinate descent)
- `isRandom = true`: Bool; whether to use random or cyclic updates

`ista!` (ISTA with fixed step size)
- `stepsize = 0.01`: Float64; fixed step size for updates
- `setStepsize = true`: Bool; whether the fixed step size should be calculated, overriding `stepsize`

`fista!` (FISTA with fixed step size)
- `stepsize = 0.01`: Float64; fixed step size for updates
- `setStepsize = true`: Bool; whether the fixed step size should be calculated, overriding `stepsize`

`fista_bt!` (FISTA with backtracking)
- `stepsize = 0.01`: Float64; initial step size for updates
- `gamma = 0.5`: Float64; multiplying factor for step size backtracking/line search

`admm!` (ADMM)
- `rho = 1.0`: Float64; parameter that controls ADMM tuning
- `setRho = true`: Float64; whether the ADMM tuning parameter should be calculated, overriding `rho`
- `tau_incr = 2.0`: Float64; parameter that controls the factor at which the ADMM tuning parameter increases
- `tau_decr = 2.0`: Float64; parameter that controls the factor at which the ADMM tuning parameter decreases
- `mu = 10.0`: Float64; parameter that controls the factor at which the primal and dual residuals should be within each other

The 3d array of coefficient estimates can be accessed using `coef(est)`. Predicted values and residuals can be obtained by calling `predict` and `resid`. By default, both of these functions use the same data used to fit the model. However, a new `Predictors` object can be passed into `predict` as the `newPredictors` argument and a new `RawData` object can be passed into `resid` as the `newData` argument. For convenience, `fitted(est)` will return the fitted values by calling `predict` with the default arguments. 

```
preds = predict(est)
resids = resid(est)
```

All four of these functions take an optional `lambda` argument, in which case only the 2d array corresponding to that value of lambda will be returned, e.g. `coef(est, lambdas[1])`. (If a lambda value that was not used in the fitting of the `Mlmnet` object is passed in, an error will be rasied.) One can also extract coefficients as a flattened 2d array by calling `coef_2d(est)`, for convenience when writing the results to flat files. 

`mlmnet_perms` permutes the response matrix `Y` in a `RawData` object and then calls `mlmnet`. By default, the function used to permute `Y` is `shuffle_rows`, which shuffles the rows for `Y`. Alternative functions for permuting `Y`, such as `shuffle_cols`, can be passed into the argument `permFun`. Non-default behavior for `mlmnet` can be specified by passing its keyword arguments into `mlmnet_perms`. 

```
estPerms = mlmnet_perms(fista_bt!, dat, lambdas)
```

Cross-validation for `mlmnet` is implemented by `mlmnet_cv`. The user can either manually specify the row/column folds of `Y` as a 1d array of 1d arrays of row/column indices, or specify the number of folds that should be used. If the number of folds is specified, disjoint folds of approximately equal size will be generated from a call to `make_folds`. Passing in `1` for the number of row (or column) folds indicates that all of the rows (or columns) of `Y` should be used in each fold. The advantage of manually passing in the row and/or column folds is that it allows the user to stratify or otherwise control the nature of the folds. For example, `make_folds_conds` will generate folds for a set of categorical conditions and ensure that each condition is represented in each fold. Cross validation is computed in parallel when possible. Non-default behavior for `mlmnet` can be specified by passing its keyword arguments into `mlmnet_cv`. 

In the call below, `mlmnet_cv` generates 10 disjoint row folds but uses all columns of `Y` in each fold (indicated by the `1`). The function returns an `Mlmnet_cv` object, which contains an array of the Mlmnet objects for each fold (`MLMNets`); the lambda penalty values used (`lambdas`); the row and column folds (`rowFolds` and `colFolds`); an array of the mean-squared error for each fold (`mse`); and an array of the proportion of zero interaction effects for each fold (`propZero`). The keyword argument `dig` in `mlmnet_cv` adjusts the level of precision when calculating the percent of zero coefficients. It defaults to `12`. 

```
Random.seed!(120)
estCVObjs = mlmnet_cv(fista_bt!, dat, lambdas, 10, 1)
```

`mlmnet_cv_summary` displays a table of the average mean-squared error and proportion of zero coefficients across the folds for each value of lambda. The optimal lambda might be the one that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE), or can be chosen based on a pre-determined proportion of zeros that is desired in the coefficient estimates. 

```
println(mlmnet_cv_summary(estCVObjs))
```

The `lambda_min` function returns the summary information for the lambdas that correspond to the minimum average test MSE across folds and the MSE that is one standard error greater. 

```
lambda_min(estCVObjs)
```

Additional details can be found in the documentation for specific functions.
